This is the home of the Proliferation Project, a personal vision for a data network of continuous discovery, data manipulation and event driven technologies.  This ia a conceptual ecosystem of automation rather than a specific product, made up of many smaller projects.

2023 Components:

1) Filesystem/File Data forensics
2) Data In Motion collection, processing, storage, and forwarding
3) Prototype data-in-motion processing, metadata manipulation, and interpreted language
4) Web based visualization tools
5) No-limit scalability
6) Metadata manipulation tools
7) Database/Datastore adapters

Why use the term "Proliferation"?  Because many of the technologies that entered into the mainstream reached the point where they were satisfactory for driving business sales, but not satisfactory for achieving the ideal state for solving the domain(s) problems:

1) Require extreme amounts of hardware, extremely slow performing
2) Limited to a specific types of data
3) Not well thought out, have artificial limitations, or limited by institutional use
4) Lack of modularity
5) No class, style, and/or makes everything too difficult
6) Lacks depth or breadth

Also, on a personal note, I have my own wonderment to pursue (i.e., nasty hacker mindset) and personal growth is very important to me (i.e., achieving entirely new technologies that matter to me and my personal life.)  The Proliferation Project is meant to grow my mastery of knowledge ecosystems, helping me improve the signal to noise ratio while extracting the meanings behind both.
